# Meeting Scheduling - Complete Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Wrong Time Being Scheduled (5:00 PM instead of selected time)
**Problem**: When users clicked on "12:00 PM - 1:00 PM", meetings were created at 5:00 PM instead.

**Root Cause**: The frontend was sending the ISO timestamp, but the backend was either not parsing it correctly or the AI was creating events with incorrect times due to timezone issues.

**Solution**: 
- Frontend now stores the exact ISO timestamp from the clicked slot in `selectedSlotTime` state
- Passes it as `selected_slot_time` parameter to the backend
- Backend prioritizes this timestamp over any text parsing
- New logic in `createCalendarEvent` checks if `start_time` is an ISO timestamp and uses it directly

**Files Modified**:
- `src/pages/Assistant.tsx`: Added `selectedSlotTime` state and passes it to backend
- `supabase/functions/assistant/index.ts`: 
  - Added `selected_slot_time` parameter extraction
  - Added priority check for ISO timestamp in `createCalendarEvent` function (lines 1320-1335)
  - Updated `calendar_create_event` case to use `selected_slot_time` when provided (lines 2322-2343)

### 2. ✅ ISO Timestamp Showing in Chat
**Problem**: Users saw ugly messages like `"Schedule meeting at 2025-10-22T10:00:00.000Z"` instead of friendly times like `"12:00 PM"`.

**Solution**: 
- Frontend now sends only the user-friendly time (e.g., "12:00 PM") as the message content
- The exact ISO timestamp is passed separately in the `selected_slot_time` parameter
- This keeps the chat clean while preserving precision for the backend

**Files Modified**:
- `src/pages/Assistant.tsx` (lines 564-574): Time slot button now displays only the time string

### 3. ✅ Google Meet Links Not Being Created
**Problem**: Virtual meetings weren't getting Google Meet links even though they were requested.

**Root Cause**: When `selected_slot_time` was being used, the `meeting_type` and `meeting_platform` parameters from the AI's tool call weren't being preserved.

**Solution**:
- Updated the `calendar_create_event` case to explicitly preserve `meeting_type` and `meeting_platform` 
- Set defaults to `'virtual'` and `'google_meet'` if not provided
- This ensures the conference data creation logic is triggered

**Files Modified**:
- `supabase/functions/assistant/index.ts` (lines 2336-2338): Preserve meeting parameters when using `selected_slot_time`

### 4. ⚠️ Duplicate Meetings (Needs Investigation)
**Problem**: Multiple identical meetings are being created.

**Possible Causes**:
1. Frontend calling `sendMessage()` multiple times
2. AI retrying failed requests
3. Race condition in event creation
4. React re-renders triggering duplicate calls

**Status**: Needs further investigation. Check the browser console for multiple API calls.

## How to Test

1. **Start fresh**: Clear your browser cache and reload
2. **Schedule a meeting**:
   ```
   User: "Can I schedule a meeting with test@example.com in two days?"
   AI: "Would you like this to be a virtual or physical meeting?"
   User: "virtual"
   AI: Shows available time slots
   User: Click "1:00 PM - 2:00 PM"
   ```

3. **Verify**:
   - ✅ Chat shows: "1:00 PM" (NOT the ISO timestamp)
   - ✅ Meeting created at: 1:00 PM on the correct date (NOT 5:00 PM)
   - ✅ Google Meet link is included in the meeting
   - ⚠️ Only ONE meeting is created (not duplicates)

## Technical Details

### Flow After Fix

1. User clicks time slot button
2. Frontend:
   - Stores `slot.start` in `selectedSlotTime` state
   - Displays friendly time ("1:00 PM") in chat
   - Sends to backend: `message: "1:00 PM"`, `selected_slot_time: "2025-10-22T13:00:00.000Z"`
3. Backend:
   - AI calls `calendar_create_event` with parameters
   - Backend checks if `selected_slot_time` is provided
   - If yes: Uses exact ISO timestamp, ignores AI's `when_text` parsing
   - Preserves `meeting_type: "virtual"` and `meeting_platform: "google_meet"`
4. `createCalendarEvent` function:
   - Detects ISO timestamp format
   - Uses it directly without timezone conversion
   - Creates event at exact time
   - Generates Google Meet link for virtual meetings
5. Result:
   - Meeting at correct time ✅
   - Friendly display in chat ✅
   - Google Meet link included ✅

## Deployment Status

- ✅ Frontend changes: Ready (requires app reload)
- ✅ Backend changes: Deployed to edge function
- ⚠️ Testing: Requires user to test with real scenario

## Next Steps

1. Test the complete flow end-to-end
2. Investigate duplicate meeting creation issue
3. Monitor console logs for any errors
4. Check if meetings sync correctly to Google Calendar
