### Backend Functions
3. **`/supabase/functions/gmail-auth/index.ts`**

   - Added `meeting_type`, `meeting_platform`, and `location` parameters to `calendar_create_event` tool
   - Updated `createCalendarEvent()` function to handle meeting types
   - Added conference data request for Google Meet links
   - Extracts and returns Google Meet link from Calendar API response

### Frontend Components
6. **`/src/components/MeetingForm.tsx`**
   - Added meeting type dropdown (Virtual/Physical)
   - Conditional rendering of meeting platform and link fields for virtual meetings
   - Conditional rendering of location field for physical meetings
   - "Generate Meet Link" button for Google Meet
   - Integration with `createGoogleMeetSpace()` utility

   - Displays location for physical meetings
   - Updated meeting interface to include `meeting_type`

### Utilities
8. **`/src/utils/googleMeet.ts`** (NEW)
   - `createGoogleMeetSpace()`: Creates Google Meet space using Meet REST API

   - `generateSimpleMeetLink()`: Fallback simple Meet link generator
   - `extractMeetingCode()`: Utility to extract meeting code from URL

## How It Works

### For AI Assistant:
1. User: "Schedule a meeting with Sarah tomorrow"
2. AI: "Would you like this to be a virtual or physical meeting?"
3. User: "Virtual"
4. AI checks calendar availability and suggests time slots
5. User selects time (e.g., "2pm")
6. AI creates calendar event with `meeting_type: "virtual"` and `meeting_platform: "google_meet"`
7. Backend automatically generates Google Meet link via Calendar API
8. AI responds with meeting details including Google Meet link

### For Online Meetings Page:
1. User clicks "Schedule Meeting"
2. Form shows meeting type dropdown
3. User selects "Virtual Meeting"
4. Form shows meeting platform selection (Google Meet, Zoom, Teams, Other)
5. For Google Meet, user can click "Generate Meet Link" button
6. System creates Meet link via Calendar API
7. Meeting is saved with link and sent to attendees

### For Physical Meetings:
1. User selects "Physical Meeting"
2. Location field becomes required
3. Meeting link fields are hidden
4. Meeting is saved with location details
5. Calendar invite includes physical location

## API Integration

### Google Meet REST API
- Scope: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/meet.space.created`
- Used via Google Calendar API's `conferenceData` field
- Automatic link generation when creating calendar events

### Calendar API
- Enhanced with `conferenceDataVersion=1` parameter for Meet links
- Supports conference data in event creation
- Returns Meet link in `entryPoints` array

## Fallback Strategy
1. **Primary**: Google Meet REST API via Calendar API `conferenceData`
2. **Secondary**: Calendar event with conference request
3. **Tertiary**: Manual link entry by user

## Database Schema

### meetings table (new columns):
```sql
meeting_type TEXT DEFAULT 'virtual' CHECK (meeting_type IN ('virtual', 'physical'))
meet_space_id TEXT  -- Google Meet space ID for reference
```

## Required OAuth Scopes
```
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/meet.space.created
```

## Testing Recommendations

### AI Assistant:
1. Test: "Schedule a meeting with John tomorrow"
   - Should ask about meeting type
   - Should generate Meet link for virtual meetings

2. Test: "Schedule a physical meeting at our office"
   - Should capture location
   - Should not generate Meet link

### Online Meetings Page:
1. Create virtual meeting with Google Meet
   - Click "Generate Meet Link" button
   - Verify link is created

2. Create physical meeting
   - Enter location
   - Verify location is saved

3. View meetings list
   - Verify correct icons show
   - Verify links/locations display correctly

## Benefits
1. **Clearer Communication**: Users specify if meeting is virtual or in-person
2. **Automatic Meet Links**: No manual creation needed for Google Meet
3. **Better Organization**: Meetings properly categorized by type
4. **Location Tracking**: Physical meeting locations are captured
5. **Enhanced UX**: Conditional UI based on meeting type

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
- Support for Zoom API integration
- Microsoft Teams meeting link generation
- Hybrid meetings (both virtual and physical)
- Meeting type analytics
- Default meeting type preference per user

## Notes
- Google Meet API must be enabled in Google Cloud Console
- Users must have active Gmail connection for Meet link generation
- Fallback to manual link entry if API fails
- Meeting types default to "virtual" for backwards compatibility
