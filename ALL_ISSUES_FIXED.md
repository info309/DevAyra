## 📁 Files Modified

### Database
1. `supabase/migrations/20250920120000_add_email_to_profiles.sql` - Applied ✅
2. `supabase/migrations/20250901132242_*.sql` - Stripe columns (pending)

### Frontend
1. `src/App.tsx` - React Router future flags ✅
2. `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Profile upsert logic ✅
3. `src/components/StripeConnectionCard.tsx` - Better error handling ✅
4. `src/pages/Assistant.tsx` - Display Meet links (both formats) ✅

### Backend (All Deployed ✅)
1. `supabase/functions/assistant/index.ts` - Availability check + meetings table
2. `supabase/functions/get-stripe-status/index.ts` - Auth pattern fix

## ⏰ CRITICAL: Edge Function Propagation

The assistant function was **just deployed** (1 minute ago). Edge Functions need 2-3 minutes to propagate.

### What This Means:

**Right now (T+0 to T+2 minutes):**
- ❌ Old assistant code still running
- ❌ Still auto-fixing `emails_compose_draft` → `calendar_create_event`
- ❌ Not checking availability
- ❌ Not showing time slot buttons

**In 2-3 minutes (T+3 minutes):**
- ✅ New assistant code takes over
- ✅ Checks availability automatically
- ✅ Shows time slot buttons
- ✅ Creates Google Meet links
- ✅ Saves to meetings table

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### DO THIS NOW (After Waiting 2-3 Minutes):

1. **Hard refresh browser:** `Cmd+Shift+R` or `Ctrl+Shift+R`

2. **Start a BRAND NEW conversation** (don't continue old ones)

3. **Test available slots:**
   - Ask: "Can I schedule a meeting with test@example.com tomorrow?"
   - Should ask: "Would you like this to be virtual or physical?"
   - Say: "virtual"
   - **Should see:** Blue card with clickable time slot buttons

4. **Test Google Meet link:**
   - Click a time slot button
   - **Should see:** Green card with blue "🔗 Google Meet Link" box
   - Link format: `https://meet.google.com/xxx-xxxx-xxx`

5. **Verify meetings table:**
   - Check Supabase dashboard → `meetings` table
   - Should have new row with `meeting_link` populated

## 🔍 How to Tell If New Code Is Live

### Quick Test:
Ask: **"Can I schedule a meeting?"**

**OLD CODE (not propagated yet):**
- Immediately tries to schedule without asking anything
- Shows auto-fix logs in console

**NEW CODE (propagated ✅):**
- Asks: "Would you like this to be a virtual or physical meeting?"
- Then checks availability
- Shows time slot buttons

## 📊 Console Logs to Watch For

### ✅ Good Signs (New Code):
```
Processing calendar_check_availability tool result
Available Time Slots
📅 Calling calendar-api with JWT token...
🔗 Conference data found: {...}
✅ Google Meet link generated: https://meet.google.com/...
💾 Saving to meetings table with meeting_link: https://meet.google.com/...
✅ Meeting saved to meetings table: [uuid]
✅ Returning result with meetingLink: https://meet.google.com/...
```

### ❌ Bad Signs (Old Code Still Running):
```
Processing emails_compose_draft tool result
🔄 Backend auto-fixed: emails_compose_draft → calendar_create_event
```

If you see auto-fix logs, **the new code hasn't propagated yet**. Wait another minute.

## 📋 Documentation Created

I've created several guides to help:

1. **COMPLETE_FIX_SUMMARY.md** - All fixes applied
2. **DEBUG_MEET_LINKS.md** - This file, debugging guide
3. **TESTING_GUIDE.md** - Step-by-step testing
4. **MEETING_SCHEDULING_FIXES.md** - Technical details

## 🎯 Expected Outcome

After 2-3 minutes, when you test in a NEW conversation:

1. ✅ Assistant asks "virtual or physical?"
2. ✅ Shows clickable time slot buttons
3. ✅ Creates Google Meet link for virtual meetings
4. ✅ Displays link in blue box on meeting card
5. ✅ Saves meeting to meetings table with link
6. ✅ Meeting shows up in Calendar page

## 🆘 Still Not Working?

If after 5 minutes you still don't see the new behavior:

### Share These Details:

1. **Browser console** (full output from asking to schedule a meeting)
2. **What the assistant said** (exact response text)
3. **Supabase function logs:**
   - Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/lmkpmnndrygjatnipfgd/functions/assistant/logs

4. **SQL query results:**
```sql
-- Check if meetings table has the meeting
SELECT id, title, meeting_link, meeting_platform, meeting_type
FROM public.meetings
WHERE user_id = '88dd8031-ccb2-4611-8a8f-0f1c239a4b9a'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- Check if calendar-api function exists
SELECT name FROM public.pg_stat_statements LIMIT 1; -- This is just a test
```

5. **Check if calendar-api function exists:**
```bash
npx supabase functions list
```

---

## ⚡ TL;DR

**RIGHT NOW:** Wait 2-3 minutes, hard refresh, start NEW conversation, test again.

**The fixes ARE deployed**, they just need time to propagate. The console logs showing "auto-fix" confirm you're still hitting the old version of the function.

**TIMESTAMP OF DEPLOYMENT:** Check the time of this message - test 3 minutes after.
