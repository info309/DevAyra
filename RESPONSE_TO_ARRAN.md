# Response to Arran - Google Meet Integration

Hi Arran,

Absolutely! Google Meet integration is definitely possible and a fantastic addition to the AI assistant. I'll work on implementing this during the weekend.

## What We Can Add:

**AI-Powered Meeting Type Detection:**
- AI will ask: "Is this a virtual or physical meeting?"
- For physical meetings: Option to add location details
- For virtual meetings: Automatic Google Meet link generation
- Integration with your Online Meetings page for manual scheduling

**Required Scopes:**
We'll need to add one additional scope: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events` (which we already have) and potentially `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/meet.space.created` for advanced Meet features.

## Implementation Plan:

1. **AI Conversation Enhancement**: Update the AI to ask about meeting type during scheduling
2. **Google Meet Integration**: Generate Meet links automatically for virtual meetings
3. **Online Meetings Page**: Create/manage virtual meetings manually
4. **Database Schema**: Add fields for meeting type, location, and Meet links
5. **UI Updates**: Enhanced scheduling interface with meeting type selection

This will make Ayra even more powerful for modern remote work scenarios. The AI will become your complete meeting management assistant!

I'll have this ready for testing by Monday. Let me know if you have any specific preferences for how the virtual meeting interface should work.

Best regards,
Meir
