# Meeting Scheduling Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Available Time Slots Not Showing
**Problem:** When asking to schedule a meeting, the assistant wasn't showing available time slots - it was creating meetings immediately.

**Root Cause:** The assistant prompt had an "EXCEPTION" rule that allowed skipping the availability check if "full details" were provided. The AI was interpreting any meeting request as having enough details.

**Solution:**
- Removed the exception rule
- Made the availability check **MANDATORY** in all cases
- Updated the workflow to ALWAYS follow these steps:
  1. Ask: virtual or physical?
  2. Call: `calendar_check_availability`
  3. Show: available slots (UI displays buttons)
  4. Create: event after user selects time

**Updated Prompt Section:**
```
❌ NEVER SKIP AVAILABILITY CHECK: Even if user says "schedule meeting at 2pm tomorrow", you MUST:
   1. Ask: virtual or physical?
   2. Call: calendar_check_availability for tomorrow
   3. Show: available slots (UI will display buttons)
   4. Then: create event when user confirms time
```

### 2. ✅ Google Meet Links Not Being Created
**Problem:** Virtual meetings weren't getting Google Meet links attached.

**Root Cause:** The auto-fix code (that converts incorrect email drafts to calendar events) wasn't explicitly setting `meeting_platform: 'google_meet'`, which is required to trigger Meet link creation.

**Solution:**
- Updated auto-fix code to explicitly include `meeting_platform: 'google_meet'`
- Added `location: ''` parameter for virtual meetings
- Ensured the parameter is passed through to the calendar creation function

**Code Update:**
```typescript
result = await createCalendarEvent(user.id, {
  title: meetingTitle,
  when_text: when_text,
  guests: to,
  description: '',
  client_timezone,
  meeting_type: 'virtual',
  meeting_platform: 'google_meet', // ← THIS triggers Meet link creation
  location: ''
}, token);
```

## How It Works Now

### Meeting Scheduling Flow

1. **User:** "Can I schedule a meeting with meirho01@gmail.com tomorrow?"
2. **Assistant:** "Would you like this to be a virtual or physical meeting?"
3. **User:** "virtual"
4. **Assistant calls:** `calendar_check_availability` for tomorrow
5. **Assistant:** "I found several available time slots for tomorrow. Please select a time from the options below!"
6. **UI shows:** Clickable time slot buttons (12:00 PM, 12:30 PM, 1:00 PM, etc.)
7. **User clicks:** "2:00 PM" button (or types "2pm")
8. **Assistant calls:** `calendar_create_event` with:
   - `meeting_type: 'virtual'`
   - `meeting_platform: 'google_meet'`
   - `guests: 'meirho01@gmail.com'`
9. **Backend:** Creates Google Meet link via Calendar API
10. **UI shows:** Meeting card with Google Meet link and "Send Invitation Message" button

### Google Meet Link Creation

The Google Meet link is created automatically when:
- `meeting_type` = `'virtual'`
- `meeting_platform` = `'google_meet'`

The backend calls Google Calendar API with `conferenceDataVersion=1` parameter, which triggers Google to generate a unique Meet link for the event.

## Testing

To test the fixes:

1. **Test Available Slots:**
   - Ask: "Can I schedule a meeting with someone@email.com tomorrow?"
   - Expect: Assistant asks "virtual or physical?"
   - Say: "virtual"
   - Expect: See available time slot buttons in the UI

2. **Test Google Meet Links:**
   - Select a time slot
   - Wait for event to be created
   - Check that the meeting card shows a Google Meet link
   - Format should be: `https://meet.google.com/xxx-xxxx-xxx`

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
1. `supabase/functions/assistant/index.ts`
   - Lines 42-69: Updated meeting scheduling workflow
   - Lines 2121-2130: Added `meeting_platform` to auto-fix code

### Deployed
- ✅ Assistant function deployed to production
- Deployment time: ~1 minute for changes to take effect

### Dependencies
- Google Calendar API (for Meet link generation)
- Active Gmail connection with Calendar scope
- `calendar-api` Edge Function (must be working)

## Verification

After deployment, the assistant will:
1. ✅ Always ask about meeting type (virtual/physical)
2. ✅ Always check availability before scheduling
3. ✅ Show clickable time slot buttons
4. ✅ Create Google Meet links for virtual meetings

## Rollback

If issues occur, the previous version can be restored from git:
```bash
git checkout HEAD~1 supabase/functions/assistant/index.ts
npx supabase functions deploy assistant --no-verify-jwt
```

## Notes

- The `calendar_check_availability` function already existed and was working
- The UI component for showing time slot buttons was already implemented
- The Google Meet link generation code was already in place
- The fixes were about making the assistant **use** these existing features correctly
